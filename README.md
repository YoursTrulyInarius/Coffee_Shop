# ☕ Coffee Shop Management System

An artisanal storefront and management system designed for bespoke coffee businesses. This system focuses on high-fidelity user experiences and streamlines inventory and order management.

> [!CAUTION]
> **🚨 ACTIVE PRODUCTION LAUNCH 🚨**
> **This system is currently in active production!** Features are being rapidly iterated upon and deployed live to ensure the highest quality "Earth & Clay" Bespoke Brand experience.

## 🌟 Recent Fixes & UI Polish (V9.2)

- **Order Cart Redesign**: Completely overhauled the cart internals. Fixed broken HTML structures and implemented a sleek, shadow-lifted layout with refined typography and perfectly aligned quantity controls.
- **Floating Search UI**: Upgraded all bland, boxy search bars into premium, pill-shaped floating inputs with soft focus rings and crisp SVG iconography (replacing old emojis).
- **Responsive Grid Stabilization**: Locked in the `.admin-main` container widths and repaired CSS media queries. The dashboard statistics, sales summaries, and complex order layouts now collapse cleanly and beautifully on tablets and mobile devices.
- **Component Restoration**: Restored missing CSS rules for the secondary toolbar, navigational tabs, and the newly implemented Sales Summary cards.
- **Layout Spacing**: Fixed unbalanced spacing issues across the admin interfaces (e.g., maximizing the distance between Search and Action buttons in the toolbar).

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Backend**: PHP (XAMPP Environment)
- **Database**: MySQL (mysqli)
- **Frontend Architecture**: 
  - Vanilla JavaScript (Custom AJAX helpers & dynamic DOM rendering)
  - Pure Vanilla CSS (Glassmorphism, Flexbox/CSS Grid, Advanced Typography)
  - Semantic HTML5
